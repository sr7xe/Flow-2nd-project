# SomeContract

This smart contract is implemented in Move, a programming language for the Move Virtual Machine (VM). It defines a contract named `SomeContract`, which includes a public struct `SomeStruct` along with various variables and functions.

## SomeStruct

### Variables

1. `a` (String): A publicly settable variable.
2. `b` (String): A publicly accessible variable.
3. `c` (String): A contract-restricted variable.
4. `d` (String): A self-restricted variable.

### Functions

1. `publicFunc()`: A public function accessible to all.
2. `contractFunc()`: A contract-restricted function.
3. `privateFunc()`: A self-restricted function.
4. `structFunc()`: A public function defined within the struct, marked by "AREA 1".

### Initialization

The struct is initialized in the contract's `init()` function, where all its variables are given default values.

## SomeResource

This contract also defines a resource named `SomeResource` with a single publicly accessible variable `e` (Int) and a function `resourceFunc()` marked by "AREA 2". The resource is initialized with a default value in its `init()` function.

## Public Functions

1. `createSomeResource()`: Creates and returns an instance of `SomeResource`.
2. `questsAreFun()`: A public function marked by "AREA 3".

## Main Module

The main module imports `SomeContract` and includes a `main()` function marked by "AREA 4".

## How to Use

1. Deploy the `SomeContract` on the Move VM.
2. Execute the various functions defined in the contract:
   - Call `createSomeResource()` to create an instance of `SomeResource`.
   - Execute `questsAreFun()` for some fun quests.
   - Explore other functionalities as per your needs.

## Dependencies

This contract depends on the module `SomeContract` from address `0x05`.
